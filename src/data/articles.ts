    content: `<p>Artificial intelligence, in popular messaging, purports to solve intelligence. Is it really possible to "solve intelligence" with the cold, cynical binary that constitutes the digital realm? The question defies an easy solution. In his book, "The Eye of the Master", associate professor in Philosophy of Science at Ca' Foscari University in Venice Matteo Pasquinelli argues the project of AI is not a pursuit of the reproduction of human intelligence but is rather a reproduction of the ways in which humans communicate socially and economically. This makes sense and is a quite standard dialectical proposition. As Marx put it, the worker is not a static fixture, but is a label placed by the owner of the means of production onto the human who performs the labor. The worker, therefore, comes into being by the ways in which they relate to others.</p>

<p>For example, the truck driver performs their task not as an agent of their own becoming, but as a middleman between two entities of higher economic power than themselves. They transport goods from point A to point B for the sole purpose of the acquisition of capital and/or other means of survival. They do not, however, do this mindlessly. As recent advancements in artificial intelligence, and more importantly their shortcomings, have demonstrated to us, it is rather difficult to program a car, much less a truck, to fully understand the logic and culture of driving in each locale. Elon Musk himself has admitted in the wake of numerous fatalities by Teslas attempting to drive themselves that, "generalized self-driving is a hard problem". Pasquinelli argues that, if AI is to truly begin driving cars and trucks fully autonomously, it is proof that "all labor is logic".</p>

<p>To really understand the core of the contradiction between human intelligence and artificial intelligence, we need to look at the history of computing. In the late 1700s, the mathematician Gaspard de Prony applied the industrial method of division of labor to hand calculation, arranging a sort of "social algorithm", dividing the calculation into 3 parts to be completed by 3 sets of clerks. A few years later in England, Charles Babbage adopted the framework of this division of labor into his "Difference Engine" which was the first prototype of the modern computer. Thus, we automated the division of labor. We created the framework by which later societies could relegate the systems of the factory floor to purely computational tasks.</p>

<p>Michel Foucault posited that discipline, enacted through segmentation of time, space, and relations, prepared the terrain for the capitalist regime of exploitation. Pasquinelli points out that this relationship is facilitated by the "eye of the master", the watchful supervisor who observes their workers and threatens to enact discipline.</p>

<p>The effects of this can be observed today, although technology has only accelerated the owner's task of enacting discipline and increased the ability for the exploitation and arbitrary segmentation of the time and geography of labor among workers. Further than the exploitation of workers, we need to recognize the reverberations felt by all of society. Even when not at work, our data is being harvested by websites, ads, and most acutely, social media. I find the short-form video a perfect example of this. More precisely, the technology which facilitates the proliferation of the short form video. TikTok is not necessarily powerful because it produces meaningful cultural products. On the contrary, I would argue that Tiktok is prolific precisely because it undermines an American culture which our generation is correctly angry at through an artificial intelligence programmed without consideration of America's goals for propaganda. This is precisely where the problem lies. America is two things at once. We are the richest, most powerful government and ownership class in the history of the world grafted onto a mass of extremely exploited working class Americans and immigrants.</p>

<p>We need to recognize this in relation to the use of technology by our government and its corporations. It is a tool for manufacturing culture and consent that can be automated and controlled by the very people that own the land we work on and the tools we use to do those jobs. It is also a tool for violent repression used to facilitate the many colonial projects our genocidal government is currently undertaking.</p>

<p>The question of defining computers as intelligent or not is therefore besides the point to me. I believe a human being is the only thing that can produce meaning in this world, and whether or not meaning is necessarily constitutive of intelligence is up to you. What is more important are the ways in which technology is used. I believe that our future lies offline, not online. At least, the future for those who desire the fullest experience of what it means to be human. I would not, however, argue for the destruction of the internet outright as many primitivists and anarchists have. I would argue for the selective acquisition of these tools by groups on the left who believe in an equitable future for the working class and oppressed peoples of the world. Successful revolutionary groups turn the tools of the empire against the empire. They do not outright reject them. A more equitable world is offline, but our road to get there involves a calculated use of AI and the internet.</p>`

    content: `<p>At the start of this year, Sylvia Burwell decided to ban indoor protests after SJP demonstrated inside the SIS building with booming chants and thunderous support from students and faculty. The ban targeted SJP, but in the initial email, The protest by the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) in TDR for the dining workers union was mentioned, meaning all clubs and orgs that engage in activism are threatened through the ban. Following the restrictions, activist clubs continued to protest, but complied with the university rules, sometimes toeing the line by protesting indoors without any noise. In response to us following the rules, the AU Administration raised the restrictions by not allowing tents, loudspeakers, or protesting near buildings while also increasing the use of AUPD and even bringing up the possibility of arming our campus police force.</p>

<p>The university will not stop curbing our right to speak freely on a college campus until we are without any rights at all. Complying with these restrictions only grants more power to the university, implying that it is okay to quiet our voice when the university engages in horrific acts: supporting a genocide, disrespecting its workers, accepting money from the Koch Foundation, neglecting survivors of sexual violence, and much more. Complying with the restrictions means we think that these horrific actions are okay.</p>

<p>Although we must break these guidelines because the university's actions are not okay, we must break them in a safe but disruptive manner. Violating these guidelines when an official club creates an event on engage is not worth the risk. For example, one day in the spring of 2024, Sunrise did a small event on the quad where they tied posters to two trees and handed out pamphlets about how American University is supporting fossil fuels and the genocide in Gaza. After we were set up, AUPD came to tell us to bring it down because it violated the Code Of Conduct. At this moment we had a choice to escalate by organizing people on the quad to come and support a barricade of some sort to ensure AUPD did not take down the posters. The Sunrise organizers decided to not take that disruptive action because their names were on Engage and they would be singled out.</p>

<p>When this disruption was canceled, I, along with others, were upset and thought it was cowardly, but pondering upon this moment I see that it was the right call. Protests and mass actions work to spread out risk, strikes and unions work because the workers know not everyone can be fired, and the lonely man who protests is much more likely to be repressed than thousands, putting strains on police forces and jails. In order to spread out risk in the future of organizing at American University we must operate secretly. The most effective way for us to work in this fashion is to disaffiliate from the university.</p>

<p>Disaffiliation from the university would not just mean a couple organizing clubs to deregister. If YDSA were to disaffiliate by themselves they could be targeted while operating on campus, but if activist, diaspora, and culture clubs all decided to separate from AU it would be a grand statement, showing the administration that we no longer support their actions and despite the consequences we choose not to be associated with this horrific institution. The university would start to be worried and we could operate in secrecy. Disbanding from AU would pose many challenges to our clubs, which are the lifeblood of campus life. The events for our clubs should not cease upon the separation, but how could a club operate without booking rooms, tabling, or requesting funds?</p>

<p>For many of the organizing clubs on campus, budget requests are not much of a necessity, they bring people to events by having food, but clubs like YDSA do well with having potlucks that generate greater community as friends cook together and are excited to show their concoctions to the meetings. Diaspora clubs, on the other hand, would suffer without budget requests as they frequently host events where food is a necessity like MSA's Iftars, or a culture club's unique cuisine for a food night. They need massive amounts of money to maintain such events, and fundraising alone will not cut it. Instead, we can follow a strategy used by the Kenyan NGO SHOFCO, which I had the privilege and pleasure to intern at. They created a system of communal welfare where every month people gave 100 Shillings (<1 dollar) to a fund that acts as a bank in times of emergencies for hospital bills, school fees, or loans for business and education. A coalition of clubs that disaffiliate could use a similar strategy, if there are 20 clubs, with each club possessing at least a membership of 10 people with an e-board of around 10 people, all giving an average of 1 dollar a month would mean $400 a month. The structure would need to be built at the community level through meetings upon meetings, to ensure we could generate a fund with all the kinks worked out. If this community fund came to fruition it would be a huge investment in our AU community. Students would feel more inclined to attend events at other club's meetings because they would be a part of the payment process for the event. Students relying on one another in this unprecedented fashion will ultimately bring our clubs closer together.</p>

<p>Assuming this great community structure works, how could clubs book rooms? Although some clubs might look for open rooms when they do not have a booking or book a room in the library for small meetings, large-scale events would be impossible to coordinate in this insane impromptu style. There would need to be large-scale cooperation between the people who work in these vital buildings to tell the clubs what rooms will be available for a meeting. To carry out this plan it would be necessary to protect the student workers through organizing for a wall-to-wall student union. The greatest threat to student worker organizations would be mass layoffs. For GW they tried to unionize their RAs and the whole program was terminated. For unionization efforts to be successful students must not go public until an unfireable amount of student workers show their solidarity. Yes, the university could fire all the RAs, but could the university fire all the RAs, all the Bridge and Dav employees, student workers in the library, East Campus, LA Quad, SIS, CAS, SPA, MGC, the gyms, and tour guides?</p>

<p>Organizing for a student union would not only help raise wages but also the ability to strike for a list of demands that the university would be forced to comply with. Imagine a campus where student workers are on strike along with the staff union, dining hall workers, janitors, and facilities workers, with hundreds of unregistered clubs protesting for days on end! There would be nothing to stop that level of collective action. We must realize that the administration rules American University through fear, force, and violence. As their power is threatened, they try to raise their capacity for retribution through increasing disciplinary actions and arming AUPD. We, the students and staff, make the campus what it is, and we can govern each other through love and community instead of laws imposed on us through fear. I do not think this will be easy, nor do I think I have all the answers on organizing every department with student workers, nor do I have the perfect solution for how community welfare should work on campus. All I know is that I am ready to have these conversations… Are you?</p>`

    content: `<p>"Trump won Pennsylvania" shouted a man in constant fervor since the morning. Our heartbeats collectively stopped momentarily, only to sink to the depths of hell. A lecture on African Regional Communities was about to start, but we could not move on. Our faces were full of despair, looking at our blue-lit screens only catastrophizing what was to come. Searching for hope, only for shooting stars to hide behind a black and ominous thunderstorm. "Sure he won the presidency, but what about the Senate and House". Oh…. "Sure they have control of all three branches, but what about the Supreme Court, or Checks and Balances, our Bureaucracy, and so on until we find a single amendment, rule, or law to cling onto to tell us everything will be okay".</p>

<p>The truth is that everything will not be okay, everything is not currently okay, and we must disregard any hope that our leaders will guide us into a more progressive and inclusive future. This does not mean we should rot, or leave the country. Giving up on hope means relinquishing our fear. We only lose ourselves in hope because we are scared of what will happen. And fear will exterminate our rights and turn us into ants unable to stand up to a householder even with a whole colony in solidarity.</p>

<p>I can hope a crazy MAGA Republican will not somehow stumble on this blog and have me jailed as one of the 'vermin' in this country, but once it starts to happen, my hope will diminish. I will only be left with fear and self-censor, giving even greater power to the state. If I had no fear of prison, no fear of what they would do to the 'enemy from within' I could be vicious with my words and even in prison be okay.</p>

<p>These are some big words from a little man. And I am scared. I am anxious. I am nervous. I am clinging on to hope, but I cannot let that control my actions.</p>

<p>What will be our action?</p>

<p>Action is our best tool to conquer our fears, I know it hasn't even been 24 hours since the results are in and people just want to be sad for the day, but this sadness and despair will not bring us out of fear. Action and seeing real positive change will be the only way to quell our anxieties and the total power of the state.</p>

<p>In our class on regional communities in Africa, I decided to write some notes regarding this:</p>

<p>What are we worried about?</p>

<p>Look into what could come from the Trump presidency, whether it's Project 2025, his speeches, what his contractors say, or what red states have been doing on a local level.</p>

<p>For me I am most worried about his mass deportation plans, crackdowns on the 'enemy within', and national bans on 'Critical Race Theory' and 'Woke Educators'. I then started thinking of the worst-case scenario for all of these policies and then what type of community systems would make the state powerless.</p>

<p>What could a community do to help the most vulnerable when ICE comes to town?</p>

<p>How can your local district 'break bad laws' while ensuring funding?</p>

<p>How can we protect protestors and journalists from massive crackdowns safely and securely?</p>

<p>For all these questions I propose the best answer usually involves the most amount of people. If communities could be on high alert when ICE comes to town using a variety of creative and intelligent schemes to physically protect migrants, by using human barriers or hiding them in homes the state would not be able to do their terrible job. To defend socio-historical teachings in grade school, massive amounts of people need to show up to their Board of Education Meetings to ensure there is a plan to protect educators, books, and curriculums that tell a real history of the United States. No apparatus, no matter how grand, bountiful, and abundant, possesses unlimited resources. In cracking down, which is what this administration will do, it uses up resources. The more they crack down the farther thin they are stretched. To defeat the United Kingdom, it took World War II, for India to finally stretch the crown out. For us, it is no different. We do not need a World War but we can create a disruption greater than it.</p>

<p>Disruption does not mean violence or massive bombing campaigns against our country. Disruptions mean to break our unjust laws at such a massive scale that would make the state powerless. Yes, the government could tear gas an encampment in DC, but does the government have the capacity to terrorize protestors in every small, medium and major city if they stood their ground for a year straight. Yes, the government could imprison a lone teacher explaining the history of racism and telling kids about sexuality and gender identity, but could the state imprison every teacher in the country? Could the state jail every medical practitioner giving out abortions?</p>

<p>There are people in our country who will support crackdowns of journalists and protestors. There are teachers in this country who do not want to teach a people's history. There are doctors who are afraid to give out abortions. But this only means we have work to do, and if we work patiently, persistently, diligently and intelligently we are bound to be successful.</p>`

    content: `<p>Back in 2020, there was a vision of the future. The ground fell out from under America. Working or ruling class, white and minority communities, right and left wing, we were all united behind a failure of globalization and capitalism: Covid-19. Bernie Sanders, a Democrat only for presidential campaigns, (although much of the current youth support for the Democratic Party would rather a Bernie-style democratic socialist vision of the future) offered an alternative future for the party that would focus our efforts on negotiating the inevitable decline of the US as an empire in a way that would be more equitable for the US and less harmful for the recipients of our imperial violence.</p>

<p>The Democrats made the grave mistake of pressuring him out of the party's apparatus. They saw his populism as a threat, not recognizing the ever growing need for reasonable populists who would push for equity by whatever means necessary. And unfortunately, the time for Bernie-style reforms is over. It is time for improvisation, to build spaces conducive to the invention of new styles of left-wing power and governance that transcend the antiquated and frankly imperialist tendencies of Bernie Sanders. Couched in rhetoric about the need to support veterans, the Vermont Senator has voted for defense bills that include funding for the military industrial complex. He has also occasionally stated his belief that the US military needs to be strong to support our commitments globally. However, unlike the rhetoric of Kamala Harris, who simply states the need for America to have, "the most lethal fighting force in the world", Bernie recognizes the need for diplomacy and reducing unnecessary military interventions. Furthermore, he is a tried and true politician who we know has a moral constitution.</p>

<p>His time has come and gone. He is too old. The old American progressivism is dying, and the new American left struggles to be born. Gone are the days of corny old white men getting powerful from their support for trade unionism. In are the days of corporate-style non-profits that commodify revolutionary leftism and sell it on the internet for donations. The left in America cannot bring the revolution into the 21st century as these capitalist non-profits outfits do. We must bring the 21st century into the revolution, building power and seizing the already burgeoning anti-capitalist left. There is a world to win, one person at a time.</p>`

    content: `<p>Technology has always been a transformative force, reshaping societies and economies. But its potential to liberate and empower is determined not by the tools themselves, but by how society organizes their use. In the digital age, data has become the new capital, replacing traditional labor as the primary source of wealth. While technology offers immense potential, its current organization under capitalism mirrors—and even amplifies—the exploitative dynamics Karl Marx critiqued in the industrial age.</p>

<p>Karl Marx argued that capitalism thrives on the exploitation of labor. Workers produce more value than they are paid for, and this surplus value becomes profit for capitalists. The result is an unequal system where the owners of capital accumulate wealth, while workers are alienated from the fruits of their labor. In Marx's time, the exploitation was clear: factory workers toiled in harsh conditions, creating goods they could never afford. Today, the means of production have shifted. Physical labor is no longer the primary driver of profit. Instead, the raw material of the digital economy is data, and the exploitation is just as pervasive—if less visible.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, our clicks, searches, and swipes generate immense wealth. Every interaction on a platform like Facebook, TikTok, or Google contributes to a pool of data that fuels targeted advertising, algorithmic development, and artificial intelligence. This data is extracted from users without compensation, monetized by corporations, and transformed into staggering profits. Platforms collect user data in exchange for "free" services, much like early industrial workers exchanged their labor for minimal wages. Corporations then use this data to optimize advertising, predict consumer behavior, and develop new technologies, generating billions of dollars annually. Users remain disconnected from the value their data creates, excluded from the profits it generates. For example, Facebook (now Meta) earns an average of $200 per U.S. user annually, while individuals receive no compensation for their contributions. The system thrives not because of the technology itself, but because the organization of society ensures that the benefits of data flow upward to corporate elites.</p>

<p>The industrial barons of Marx's time have been replaced by the tech monopolies of today. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta dominate the infrastructure of the digital economy, amassing control over the data, algorithms, and platforms that drive modern life. They consolidate power by controlling platforms and ecosystems, leaving users with little choice. Data collection and algorithmic processes are deliberately hidden, preventing users from understanding how their information is used. The immense profits generated by data are concentrated in the hands of a few, exacerbating inequality on a global scale. This arrangement is not inevitable. It is the result of a societal organization that prioritizes profit over fairness, centralization over empowerment, and secrecy over transparency. Technology itself is not the problem; rather, it is how society has structured its ownership and use.</p>

<p>Technology has the potential to liberate rather than exploit. It can connect communities, democratize access to information, and create new forms of wealth. But for this potential to be realized, we must rethink how society organizes the digital economy. Individuals must have control over their data and the ability to decide how it is used. The wealth generated by data should be shared with those who create it—every user of a platform. Algorithms and data practices should be open and accountable, ensuring fairness and preventing abuse. By breaking up tech monopolies and building decentralized systems, we can create a digital economy that empowers individuals rather than corporations. These changes require reimagining the relationship between technology and society. Data should be seen as a public good, not a private commodity, and the digital infrastructure that supports modern life should serve the many, not the few.</p>

<p>Karl Marx's critique of capitalism reminds us that exploitation is not inherent to labor or technology—it is a product of how society organizes its resources. In the digital age, data has become the new site of exploitation, but the principles remain the same: a small elite extracts immense wealth from the contributions of the many. As we navigate this new era, it is vital to recognize that technology itself is neutral. Its capacity to liberate or oppress depends entirely on how it is structured within society. By challenging the current organization of the digital economy, we can build a future where technology empowers individuals and creates a fairer, more equitable world. The tools for change are already in our hands—it's time to use them.</p>`
