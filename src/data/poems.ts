    content: `Is it possible to love the sun… 
And keep emotions unfettered when clouds shade the day?
And hear our sky boom with no fear?
While raindrops crawl through our skin with no disgust?
With blistering cold that grant sickness with no pain?
Is it possible to live life with lavish and stablity?
Or to enjoy the rays give way to hate the rain?`,

    content: `Can I be a tree…
Colorfully murdering my leaves when the sun hides behind the horizon
Corpses, who, bring new life when the times right
Following our sun in most unique ways
Sprouting tall and straight
But also…
Growing in ways that contort your face
All the while…
Providing the sweetest of seeds 
Ensuring an Eden for all`,

    author: "SuperNotNitin",
    content: `But First:
I will meditate
But first some tea 
to keep me up
Then the bathroom
For it's gone down
Then some stretches
That clear my jitters
Then a fruit
Wait a minute to digest
Then another to shit
Finally a shower
To clear my head
Sitting down
Deep in thought
10 minutes pass
And gravity hits my eyelids
Slumber becomes my fiancé
Hoping our Union comes soon
I get up 
To make water dance
I will meditate again
But first some tea`,

    author: "SuperNotNitin",
    content: `Oh Fluff:
I blew a dandelion full of fluff
Only one to survive
But why hang on?

When all your friends gone
Struggling in the wind
Holding the stems head
Ensuring no graceful fall
But why hang on?

I ask my hand
Who's held the stem for too long
Looking at the wrestling fluff
Analyzing its fight for so long
But why hang on?`,
